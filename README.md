## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design with media queries

### What I learned

- I have more experience with flexbox and responsive design
- Using grid and designing layouts with it 
- Putting to use the advice received after completing my two other projects

### Continued development

- I need to practice more especially grid, as it looks like an amazing tool
- First I tried to design a responsive grid with " grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit), minmax (240px,1fr);" but it wasn't working as intended. I should study more about that
